The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://forums.gradle.org).

### Deprecations in Tooling API communication

## Potential breaking changes

### Changes to incubating native support

* '-Xlinker' is no longer automatically added to linker args for GCC or Clang. If you want to pass an argument directly to 'ld' you need to add this escape yourself.
